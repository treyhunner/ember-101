# Where do I go next?

There are many great resources available to continue your learning with Ember. The book [Rock n' Roll with Ember.js][rnr-ember] by Balinti Erdi is a book that slowly introduces concepts and best practices as you build an Ember application. It crushes the perceived learning curve of Ember and helps to overcome that initial frustration, and help you grok Ember a lot faster, by pinpointing the core concepts and explaining them in detail.

The Ember guides are great for diving deep once you understand the fundamentals. They're also versioned so you can be sure you're looking at accurate information for whatever version you happen to be working with.
